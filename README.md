# AWS Serverless Image Handler Lambda wrapper for Thumbor
A solution to dynamically handle images on the fly, utilizing Thumbor (thumbor.org).
Published version, additional details and documentation are available here: https://aws.amazon.com/answers/web-applications/serverless-image-handler/

_Note:_ it is recommend to build the application binary on Amazon Linux.

## Running unit tests for customization
* Clone the repository, then make the desired code changes
* Next, run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests
```
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh  \n
./run-unit-tests.sh \n
```

## Building distributable for customization
* Configure the bucket name of your target Amazon S3 distribution bucket
```
export TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where cfn template will reside
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where customized code will reside
export VERSION=my-version # version number for the customized code
```
_Note:_ You would have to create 2 buckets, one named 'my-bucket-name' and another regional bucket named 'my-bucket-name-<aws_region>'; aws_region is where you are testing the customized solution. Also, the assets  in bucket should be publicly accessible.

* OS/Python Environment Setup
```bash
yum install yum-utils epel-release -y
sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install zip wget git libpng-devel libcurl-devel gcc python-devel libjpeg-devel -y
alias sudo='sudo env PATH=$PATH'
sudo pip install setuptools==39.0.1
sudo pip install virtualenv==15.2.0
```
* Clone the github repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-image-handler.git
```

* Navigate to the deployment folder
```bash
cd serverless-image-handler/deployment
```

* Now build the distributable
```bash
sudo ./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $VERSION
```

* Deploy the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. Note: you must have the AWS Command Line Interface installed.
```bash
aws s3 cp ./dist/ s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-[region_name]/serverless-image-handler/$VERSION/ --recursive --exclude "*" --include "*.zip"
aws s3 cp ./dist/serverless-image-handler.template s3://$TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET/serverless-image-handler/$VERSION/
```
_Note:_ In the above example, the solution template will expect the source code to be located in the my-bucket-name-[region_name] with prefix serverless-image-handler/my-version/serverless-image-handler.zip

* Get the link of the serverless-image-handler.template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.
* Deploy the Serverless Image Handler solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the link of the serverless-image-handler.template
```bash
https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket-name/serverless-image-handler/my-version/serverless-image-handler.template
```

## SafeURL hash calculation
* For hash calculation with safe URL, use following snippet to find signed_path value
```bash
http_key='mysecuritykey' # security key provided to lambda env variable
http_path='200x200/smart/sub-folder/myimage.jpg' # sample options for myimage
hashed = hmac.new(str(http_key),str(http_path),sha1)
encoded = base64.b64encode(hashed.digest())
signed_path = encoded.replace('/','_').replace('+','-')
```
